This document introduces someone new to Letsfix.

### Welcome to Letsfix

Letsfix is a grassroots way for individuals to come together to fix the world around them.


There's lots of good intention out in the world, but that doesn't always translate into results.

We want to be able to:

(1) Demonstrate what needs fixing. We envision an easy to use system to file bug reports on the real world. Other users can help contribute to why these issues are important, and add their support towards the fix.

(2) Organize possible actionable solutions for each issue.

(3) Maintain the connection among the people who already feel motivated towards fixing a cause.
