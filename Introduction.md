## Do more than just talk about problems, *fix* them.

### Welcome to Letsfix

##### Letsfix is a grassroots platform for individuals to come together to fix the world around them.


There's lots of good intention out in the world, but that doesn't always translate into results.

Use Letsfix to:

(1) Demonstrate what needs fixing. File [bug reports](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bug_tracking_system) on the real world. Other users can help contribute to why these issues are important, and add their support towards the fix.

(2) Develop a community motivated to fix that cause.

(2) Organize solutions.
