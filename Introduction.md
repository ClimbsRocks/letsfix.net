## Do more than just talk about problems, *fix* them.

### Welcome to Letsfix

##### Letsfix is a grassroots platform for individuals to come together to fix the world around them.


There's plenty of good intention in the world, but that doesn't always translate into results. Use Letsfix to:

* **Point out** what needs fixing. File [bug reports](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bug_tracking_system) on the real world. Other users can help contribute to why these issues are important, and add their support towards the fix.

* **Develop a community** motivated to fix that cause. Stay in contact, without fear of spam.

* **Organize solutions**. Harness the wisdom of the crowd to bring the best ideas to the forefront.
