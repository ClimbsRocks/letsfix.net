# How to Solve Problems: The Letsfix Process

From [soup to nuts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soup_to_nuts), how does one use the Letsfix process to solve an issue?

### Step 1. Identify
##### "As any doctor can tell you, the most crucial step toward healing is having the right diagnosis. If the disease is precisely identified, a good resolution is far more likely." — Dr. Andrew Weil
Answer these questions to open a new Issue on Letsfix.
  * What is the issue? Just a short title.
  * What community is affected? Does this issue affect the whole world or one particular group of people? For example, your country, school, or organization.
  * What are the facts of the problem? This section can be collaboratively improved. Try to think about:
    * How long has this been a problem?
    * Where can we see it?
    * Is it clear what causes the problem?
    * How many people are affected, and to what degree?
    * Is the problem getting better or worse?
    * Are there other references or written articles about the problem?

### Step 2. Spread Awareness
##### "Alone we can do so little, together we can do so much." — Helen Keller
  * Share the link to the issue page with friends. Could use email, Facebook, Twitter, or any other social networks.
  * Visitors will be able to add themselves to each issue: *"This is important, Let's Fix!"*
    * The community shows how widespread it wants a fix to this issue.
    * This also makes it easier for each individual to follow up later. They will be able to see all issues they've identified, and could get a polite reminder after a period of time.

### Step 3. Resolve
##### "None of us is as smart as all of us." — Ken Blanchard
We gather our options to fix into a *Ways to Fix* list. This makes it easier for the people who care to solve this problem.
  * What efforts are already underway to address this problem?
  * What individual actions would help?
  * Everyone's suggestions are welcome.
  * Each person can upvote/downvote a particular option if they think it's good, neutral, or bad. This will lift the most supported ideas to the top of the list.


######  Critisms and suggestions for this process are always welcome.
