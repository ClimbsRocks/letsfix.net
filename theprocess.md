# How to Solve Problems: The Letsfix Process

From [soup to nuts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soup_to_nuts), how can someone use the Letsfix process to solve an issue?

### Step 1. Identify the Problem
##### "As any doctor can tell you, the most crucial step toward healing is having the right diagnosis. If the disease is precisely identified, a good resolution is far more likely." — Dr. Andrew Weil
Answer these questions to open a new Issue on LetsFix. Here's the [New Issue form](https://simplesurvey.typeform.com/to/yqo8ek).
  * What is the issue? (Just a short title.)
  * Describe the problem. *What are the facts?* This section can be collaboratively improved. Some suggestions to think about:
    * How long has this been a problem? Where can we see it? What causes the problem? How many people are affected? To what degree? Is the problem getting better or worse? Where has this problem been written about?
  * Who's affected? Is this specific to one group, or the whole world?

### Step 2. Spread Awareness
##### "Alone we can do so little, together we can do so much." — Helen Keller
  * Share the link to the issue page with friends. Email, Facebook, Twitter, &c work well.
  * Visitors will be able to add themselves to each issue: *"This is important, Let's Fix!"*
    * The community shows how widespread it wants a fix to this issue.
    * This also makes it easier for each individual to follow up later. They will be able to see all issues they've identified, and can get a polite reminder after a period of time.

### Step 3. Gather Solutions
##### "None of us is as smart as all of us." — Ken Blanchard
We gather any options for resolution into a list of potential fixes. This clarifies paths to solve the problem.
  * What efforts are trying to address this problem?
  * What can individuals do to help?
  * Everyone's suggestions are welcome. Each person can up/down vote a suggestion if it's good, neutral, or bad, lifting the most supported ideas to the top.
