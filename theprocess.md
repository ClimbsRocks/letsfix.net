# How to Solve Problems: The LetsFix Process

#### How should I solve a problem?

### Step 1. Identify the Problem
##### "As any doctor can tell you, the most crucial step toward healing is having the right diagnosis. If the disease is precisely identified, a good resolution is far more likely." — Dr. Andrew Weil
Answer these questions to start a new Problem page. Here's the [New Problem form](https://simplesurvey.typeform.com/to/yqo8ek).
  * What is the problem? (Just a short title.)
  * Describe it. *What are the facts?* This section can be collaboratively improved, so don't stress over it. Some questions it should eventually answer:
    * How long has this been a problem? Where can we see it? What causes it? How many people are affected? To what degree? Is the problem getting better or worse? Has this been written about?
  * Who's affected? Is this specific to one group, or the whole world?

### Step 2. Spread Awareness
##### "Alone we can do so little, together we can do so much." — Helen Keller
  * Share the link to the Problem page with friends. Email, Facebook, Twitter, &c work well.
  * Visitors will be able to add themselves to each Problem: *"This is important, Let's Fix!"*
    * The community shows how widespread it wants a fix to this issue.
    * This also makes it easier for each individual to follow up later. They will be able to see all Problems they've identified, and can get a polite reminder after a period of time.

### Step 3. Gather Solutions
##### "None of us is as smart as all of us." — Ken Blanchard
We gather any options for resolution into a list of potential fixes. This clarifies paths to solve the problem.
  * What efforts are trying to address this problem?
  * What can individuals do to help?
  * Everyone's suggestions are welcome. Each person will be able to up/down vote a suggestion if it's good, neutral, or bad, lifting the most supported ideas to the top.
