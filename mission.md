## The Mission of Letsfix


#### To identify the issues we face
It's *really* hard to pinpoint, to identify issues. To get exactly what the problems are.

If you are able to figure out what the issue is, it becomes so much easier to actually solve. Knowing is half the battle. Just like a doctor, you have to diagnose first, and then treat.

#### To work towards solutions
We want to offer a place that contributions to build on each other over time. We want to make forward progress towards goals and not let that positive energy go to waste.

#### To bridge the communication gap.
Biggest issue is often communication.

A lot of problems are the result of misunderstanding in communication.

It's not that people aren't communicating properly. That might be one part of it. But there's also a problem with understanding, with listening. Not putting yourself in other peoples shoes. Not hearing what they are saying. And taking it personally.

#### To coordinate group effort around individual issues
How can we get the tens of thousands of people that want to work on something on the same page about what we can do?

#### To make it easy for everyone to participate in the world around them
In the spirit of open partipation and democratic values, we want everyone to feel like they have the right to have a basic say in the issues affecting their lives.

#### To educate about how to fix issues.
We want to make it easy for anyone and everyone to improve the world around them.
