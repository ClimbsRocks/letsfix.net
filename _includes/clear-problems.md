# This is a guideline for writing the most effective Problem pages.

### Title: The Problem should have a clear, explicit title.
* We need to know what we are talking about.
* You want the title to communicate exactly what the problem is, including to someone that's unfamiliar with it.
* The more specific the title, the more focused the solutions can be.
